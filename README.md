# Project Scenario:
In the manufacturing industry, the risk of every product needs to be monitored. On this project, a ML/DS candidate is required to build a ML/DL model that can classify a product as LOW or HIGH risk. Each sample (or row) in the provided data corresponds to a product, contain all information related to the product along with its label (column name ‘label’).
Datasets:
- train.csv: used for training
- test.csv: used for testing

Expected Outcomes:
- Define appropriate metrics for this problem.
- Visualize and describe useful insights from data.
- Show your skill in feature engineering. It’s important to note that the types of features include categorical, numerical, text.
- Build ML/DL models to boost your chosen metrics and show your best performance. To be plus, you could implement several types of algorithms, including machine learning, deep learning, … to show your implementing skills.
- Draft some conclusion about this project.
- Propose several methods to boost the performance.
